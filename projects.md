Ideas for small scale oceanograpic data science project! 
- automated notebook to check for cleanliness of data files for integratability into databases/larger systems
  - produce md file to be filled out with metadata from vaiables/columns etc in data 
- demo for best practices for data organization and management
- maine species distribution (ATN Network)
- entry level data analysis with buoy data or ocean temp trends
- microplastic polution trends ? (not sure about data accessibility)
