Ideas for small scale oceanograpic data science project! 
Personal:
- automated notebook to check for cleanliness of data files for integratability into databases/larger systems
  - produce md file to be filled out with metadata from vaiables/columns etc in data 
- demo for best practices for data organization and management
- maine species distribution (ATN Network)
- entry level data analysis with buoy data or ocean temp trends
- microplastic polution trends ? (not sure about data accessibility) 

General Topics:
- data viz tutorials for satalites, models, moorings
- mapping (to understand the data_
- data integration of different types of data
- optimization of mooring location (buoy)
- big data (reading, chunking, parallel computing)
- data options
  - spatial temporal variability SST
  - spectal data from cruise
  -  scallop data (gulf of maine)
- evaluating ML for understanding chaotic processes
- build a data analysis tool that helps run simple analyses
- predictive modeling using lower water column data (bottom temp, depth, etc)
- building a tool to help reserachers determine data cleanliness for data integration
